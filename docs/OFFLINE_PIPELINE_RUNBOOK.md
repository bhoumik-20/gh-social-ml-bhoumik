# Offline Pipeline Operations Runbook

This runbook covers the two Person 1 worker processes:

1. repository corpus acquisition, enrichment, and backend v2 delivery;
2. enriched GitHub Trending snapshot delivery to backend v2.

Both are offline jobs. Do not invoke either command from an API request handler.
For the Redis/Qdrant online services, deployment, feedback replay, alerting, and
rollout procedures, use the [V2 production operations runbook](PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md).

## Safety contract

- The backend is the production source of truth and creates canonical repository UUIDs.
- Workers write neither PostgreSQL nor Qdrant directly.
- Backend repository mappings are validated before a source is counted as delivered.
- Trending snapshots are complete and atomically activated by the backend.
- Repository and user embeddings must use the model and dimension published by the embedding owner.
- Checkpoints contain repository identities and bounded error messages, not tokens or README content.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace every placeholder used by the worker.

Required for production corpus acquisition:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `BACKEND_URL`
- `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`
- `CORPUS_TARGET_COUNT` (default `50000`)
- `ACQUISITION_MAX_CYCLES` (default `1`)
- `ACQUISITION_CHECKPOINT_PATH`

`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is optional. Without it, README Markdown restructuring is skipped while normal README processing continues.

Trending uses the same backend credentials and enriches scraped repositories before publishing a snapshot.

## Network-free validation

These commands validate parsing and required configuration without contacting GitHub, Postgres, Qdrant, or OpenRouter:

```bash
uv run python main.py --validate-config
uv run python trending_service.py --validate-config
```

Validation success does not prove that credentials are accepted or that a remote service is healthy. It proves the local worker configuration is internally valid.

## Corpus acquisition

Run one bounded production cycle (`ingestion_engine.py` remains a compatibility
alias for this same command):

```bash
uv run python main.py \
  --limit 150 \
  --batch-size 15 \
  --workers 4 \
  --min-readme-chars 200 \
  --max-cycles 1
```

The target defaults to `CORPUS_TARGET_COUNT`. `--limit` bounds one discovery cycle; it does not request the full corpus target at once.

Embedding and Qdrant indexing are scheduled by the backend outbox after successful repository delivery.

### Stop and resume

- Stop the foreground process with `Ctrl+C` or the platform's normal `SIGTERM` shutdown.
- Do not delete the checkpoint after an interrupted or degraded run.
- Restart with the same configuration and checkpoint path.
- Pending backend delivery is re-enriched from its repository identity before retry.

The default checkpoint is `.cache/acquisition_checkpoint.json`. Writes use atomic replacement. Do not edit the file while a worker is running.

### Corpus exit codes

- `0`: the bounded invocation completed, including a no-work target-reached run.
- `1`: configuration, startup, backend verification, or pipeline execution failed.
- `2`: failures were recorded and the run made no backend-delivery progress.

Inspect the final `Corpus run report` log and the checkpoint's `last_run`,
`failures`, and `pending_persistence` fields before retrying an exit code `2`.
`pending_index` is retained only for checkpoint backward compatibility; the
production worker does not write Qdrant directly.

## Trending refresh

Run one forced refresh and publish an atomic snapshot to the backend:

```bash
uv run python trending_service.py --once
```

Run the long-lived scheduler:

```bash
uv run python trending_service.py --scheduled
```

The scheduler handles `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`. A normal stop clears its in-process schedule and exits the loop.

The production path is `trending worker → backend snapshot API → backend outbox → ML refresh → Qdrant`. The trending worker never connects to Qdrant or patches repository payloads directly. An incomplete enrichment batch or failed backend snapshot request fails the refresh atomically; inspect the backend outbox and ML refresh workers for downstream delivery failures.

## Diagnosis

| Symptom | Meaning | Safe action |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` configuration error | Token is absent or still a placeholder | Set a real token and rerun network-free validation |
| Backend verification failure | Authenticated repository delivery cannot be trusted | Correct `BACKEND_URL`/`INTERNAL_API_SECRET`; do not bypass delivery |
| No acquisition progress | Discovery returned nothing new, filtering rejected everything, or the backend canonical count did not advance | Inspect rejection and failure records before increasing limits |
| `pending_persistence` is non-empty | Repositories still require enrichment and backend delivery | Rerun the same bounded corpus command |
| Legacy `pending_index` is non-empty | A pre-cutover checkpoint still records direct-index work | Do not write Qdrant directly; reconcile those repository IDs through backend ingestion/outbox and then retire the legacy checkpoint state |
| Trending repository is missing in Qdrant | The backend outbox or ML refresh has not completed, or the repository has no approved corpus point | Inspect backend outbox/ML refresh state; let normal corpus acquisition approve missing repositories rather than writing Qdrant from the trending worker |
| Unsupported embedding model | The embedding owner has not published a compatible model/dimension contract | Keep the current model until the shared embedding interface is updated |

## Verification before handoff

Run the deterministic suite:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

Tests mock external services. A default test run must not contact GitHub, Postgres, Qdrant, or OpenRouter.

Before handing a new corpus to online serving, confirm the backend outbox has
completed repository embed/refresh jobs and authenticated V2 health reports an
eligible count above `MIN_ELIGIBLE_REPOSITORIES`. Points missing the pinned
embedding revision or required feature-spec version must be reindexed through
the backend outbox; do not weaken production eligibility to accept them. The
same validated reindex must stamp
`serving_eligibility_version=repository-vector-v1` atomically with the vector;
never backfill that marker with a payload-only patch. See the production
runbook for the coordinated cutover and the limits of write-time vector
certification.
