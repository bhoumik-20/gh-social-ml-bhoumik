# Heavy Ranker Architecture Specification

## 1. Overview
The Heavy Ranker is a PyTorch-based Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) Neural Network. It acts as the second stage in a Two-Stage Recommendation Pipeline, taking a candidate pool of 150 repos from the Vector Database (Light Ranker) and scoring them in real-time.

## 2. Input Tensor (Dimension: 778)
The network requires a single concatenated tensor of size 778, consisting of 3 core blocks:

### A. Semantic Embeddings (768 dims)
- `user_embedding`: 384-dimensional dense float array (Tracks semantic intent)
- `repo_embedding`: 384-dimensional dense float array (Tracks semantic content)

### B. Dense Metadata Features (10 dims)
*Note: All 10 features must be processed using a `StandardScaler` (to normalize them to a standard distribution) before entering the network.*

**Quality & Health Metrics**
1. `doc_quality` (0.0 to 1.0 scale)
2. `code_health` (0.0 to 1.0 scale)
3. `readme_length` (Integer word/character count)

**Popularity & Engagement Metrics**
4. `star_count` (Integer)
5. `fork_count` (Integer)
6. `open_issues_count` (Integer)

**Freshness & Momentum Metrics**
7. `pushed_days_ago` (Integer days)
8. `activity_score` (Float)
9. `trend_velocity` (Float)

**Dynamic Cross-Features**
10. `skill_match_score` (Float percentage 0.0-1.0)
    - This is entirely stateless and calculated inside `RankerService`. It performs a fast set intersection between the user's profile terms and the repository `languages/topics/tags` Qdrant payload fields.

## 3. Network Outputs (5 Tasks)
The MMoE architecture routes the 778-dim input through 4 Shared Experts, and outputs 5 distinct predictions via 5 Task Heads:

1. `Click Probability (CTR)` (Binary Classification -> Sigmoid, 0.0 to 1.0)
2. `Save Probability` (Binary Classification -> Sigmoid, 0.0 to 1.0)
3. `GitHub Open Probability` (Binary Classification -> Sigmoid, 0.0 to 1.0)
4. `Follow Probability` (Binary Classification -> Sigmoid, 0.0 to 1.0)
5. `Dwell Time` (Regression -> ReLU, normalized fraction 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 = 600s)

## 4. The Value Function (Final Ranking)
The 5 outputs are fed into the canonical ML value function in `inference/value_function.py`. The candidate pool is sorted descending by this internal score before feed shaping.

`Score = (1.0 * p_ctr) + (5.0 * p_save) + (2.0 * p_gh) + (0.1 * p_dwell) + (20.0 * p_follow)`

## 5. Backend v2 Serving Contract
The Heavy Ranker evaluates the entire candidate pool before shaping or truncation. Qdrant records must use the backend-issued UUID `repo_id`; names and URLs are attributes only.

**The Production Flow:**
1. **Retrieval:** Qdrant supplies semantic and discovery candidates with complete payloads and 384-dimensional vectors.
2. **True Ranking:** ML passes the complete candidate pool through the network and sorts it by the canonical value score.
3. **Feed Shaping:** ML removes seen UUIDs and applies freshness, language diversity, and exploration.
4. **Recommendation Response:** ML returns only unique `{repo_id, score, source}` items plus `schema_version`, `generation_id`, `user_id`, `feed_version`, `model_version`, and `embedding_version`.
5. **Backend Serve:** The backend persists the feed serve and hydrates repository cards from PostgreSQL. ML never serves repository metadata directly to the frontend.

The three internal 15-item batches remain a compatibility implementation detail for the existing v1 adapter. They are not the backend v2 wire contract.
